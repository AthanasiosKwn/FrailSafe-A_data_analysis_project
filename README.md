# FrailSafe-A_data_analysis_project

## Geriatric Frailty under the scope of Data Analysis.

The project deals with the analysis of data derived from the FrailSafe program
(https://frailsafe-project.eu/ - I do not own the data used - All rights reserved). Funded by
the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, FrailSafe aims to 
understand geriatric frailty through modern data mining and analysis techniques
(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340627315_FrailSafe_An_ICT_Platform_for_
Unobtrusive_Sensing_of_Multi-Domain_Frailty_for_Personalized_Interventions).

A small subset of the FrailSafe dataset is analyzed with the objective of identifying the conditions under which geriatric frailty develops, as well as determining whether frailty levels can be predicted using machine learning methodologies. The analysis leverages medical data, along with other relevant information, to train predictive models.

The repository contains the following:
1) A project report.
2) Three Jupyter notebooks containing the project code, along with detailed step-by-step markdown commentary.

The data has not been uploaded due to licensing restrictions. I intend to release the CSV files once the appropriate permissions have been obtained.
